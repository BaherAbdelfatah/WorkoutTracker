Idea description
You can workout everywhere at home, gym or club.
But more importantly than starting a workout is to do the exercise in the correct form.
Thus you can avoid:

 Injuries.

 Lower gains even after long training sessions.

 An asymmetry muscle shape.

Also you will have the benefits:

 Being in shape in a shorter time.

 Increasing the reps Count.


 A healthier body.
So we came up with the idea of a workout tracker to track your body posture while training and detect any mistakes in the exercise.
First it identifies the type of exercise you are doing whether it is: push-ups,pull-ups,sit-ups and much more.
Then it will track your body posture movement and warn you if you do any mistake, also it will guide you to the correct form of the exercise so that avoiding any risks caused by wrong form training.

Project plan

The project will be implemented using Android and OpenCv.
The implementation is going to pass by several steps:

 Embed the application with the correct pose of various exercises.

 Use PoseNet to estimate the pose of the user.

 Match the pose of the user with the closest supported pose in the application.

 Calculate the difference between the two poses.

 Warn the user about his wrong pose and show him the correct one.
